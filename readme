Atom.py   
simulates posible positions of the elctron in a hydrogen atom, its a cloud of create_electrons
indincating that the position is probabilty

hygrogen.py
returns a probability of finding an elecgtron at a given r radius of Bohr
uses montecarlo algorithim
 vary this variable to improve prediction

Electron plot file 
is an extension of hydrogen.py
plots Distribution of the electron in a 3d scale, the brighter the point, the higher the  probability
